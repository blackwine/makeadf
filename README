=== MakeAdf ===

MakeAdf is an AdfLib based utility to create adf (amiga disk file) floppy files, ie. floppy images for the amiga.
The LibAdf version distributed with MakeAdf has been patched to use c99 style stdint.h (int32_t, int16_t, etc.) so that it works properly on x86_64 platforms.

== Compiling & Installing ==
cd MakeAdf
make
make install

if you want, you can also compile unadf

cd Demo
make

Note: this unadf version will actually work on a x86_64 system

== Authors ==
MakeAdf is written by Fredrik Hultin ( http://grimnorth.se/~noname/ ) and is based on LibAdf by Laurent Clevy ( http://lclevy.free.fr/adflib/ ).

== License ==
MakeAdf, like LibAdf, is distributed under the GPLv2 license.
